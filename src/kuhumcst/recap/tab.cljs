  "Tab components that rely entirely on external, derefable state, e.g. a ratom.
  The `state` should always deref as a map with the following required keys:

    :kvs - key-value pairs of tab headers and bodies.

  And optionally:

    :i - the index of the currently selected tab.

  The tab `head` and `body` are - in principle - decoupled. However, a merged
  representation is available through the `window` component.")
